        Actinic keratosis (AK), also known as solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. 
        These growths often appear on sun-exposed areas like the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips.
        AKs are considered the first step in the development of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma, but not all AKs will progress to cancer.
        It is more common in fair-skinned individuals and those with a history of frequent sun exposure.

        Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, is a chronic skin condition that causes itchy, inflamed skin. 
        It is often associated with a family history of allergic conditions such as asthma, hay fever, or food allergies.
        The exact cause is unclear, but it involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
        Common triggers include allergens, irritants like soap, emotional stress, and dry skin. 
        Atopic dermatitis is common in children but can occur at any age.

        Benign keratosis, also known as seborrheic keratosis, is a non-cancerous tumor that forms on the skin. 
        These growths are often waxy or scaly and can vary in color from light tan to black.
        Seborrheic keratosis is generally considered a normal part of aging, especially for people over 40, although it can occur earlier in life.

        Contact dermatitis is a form of eczema that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an irritant or allergen. 
        It can be caused by substances like soaps, fragrances, metals (e.g., nickel), plants (e.g., poison ivy), or cleaning chemicals.
        There are two types: irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis. Symptoms include redness, itching, and sometimes blisters.

        It is believed to be caused by an overgrowth of a yeast called *Malassezia*, which triggers inflammation.
